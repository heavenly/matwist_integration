2. Add this userscript to the extension above

3. Done - all you need to do is setup myanimelistid for each anime when required.

4. Read console for any information

To use on an anime (only once per anime):

1. Open up the anime you want to log on twist.moe

2. Open up javascript console on your browser

3. type "set_current_anime_id(the myanimelist id here);" (without quotes)

4. done - do this process for any anime you want logged

5. Your animelist gets updated as soon as you go on myanimelist. Don't stay offsite for too long, it might cause issues if you try updating 5000 animes at once.
